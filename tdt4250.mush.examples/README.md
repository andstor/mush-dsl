First, make sure the Mush plugin is  installed. See the [intstallation](../README.md#install) instructions.

Then import the `tdt4250.mush.examples` project into the Eclipse workspace.
## Examples
All examples are located in the [`src`](src) folder. When a mush file is edited and saved, the mush code gets compiled down to Java code, and  placed in the [`src-gen`](src-gen/) folder.

### MatrixAddition
This mush code takes takes in two, 2-dimentional lists and returns a new 2-dimentional list with the sum of the two inputs. The code uses for-loops, while-loops, makes new list, get size of list, add to list and change value in an element of the list, as well as a comparing operations and arithmetic expressions.

### SchoolClass
This code has a list with the names of the students, and a list with the grade of each student. The code prints out the name of each student with the grade there grade.
